                        In ancient Greek mythology, Ambrosia is the nectar of the gods: a food or drink that blessed
                        whoever
                        ate it with longevity or immortality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The American version of Ambrosia will not bless anyone with a longer life. (In fact, it’s more
                        likely to do the opposite). But it has been a staple in my family’s Thanksgiving meals for
                        generations.

                        My great grandmother, Florence Keith Dale, made the recipe below. She was born in Michigan and
                        lived
                        in Houghton Lake&mdash;known as "Grandma Dale" by my mom and her sisters. It’s easy to imagine
                        her
                        recipe as a common Midwestern staple: a bit of comfort food for dessert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Filled with happy, colorful ingredients such as cherries, pineapple and marshmallows, it’s no
                        wonder
                        why it was a fun dish to make and eat as a kid. Add some whipped cream and jello, and I wouldn’t
                        necessarily call this a "fruit salad" as it’s usually described. But it is easy to
                        make&mdash;just a
                        matter of mixing all the ingredients together&mdash;and definitely easy to eat.

                        The version I make now-a-days is vegan. I simply swap the jello and cool whip for store-bought
                        vegan
                        versions. A nice alternative for the cool whip can be whipping up some chilled coconut cream
                        with
                        added sifted powdered sugar. Our family also adds walnuts for a bit of crunch, but that’s
                        optional
                        and based on personal preference.

                        A fluffy fruit and whipped cream dessert. Great served at Thanksgiving next to pumpkin pie, in
                        place
                        of the traditional whipped cream topping. Kids can easily help make (and eat) it!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul id="ingredients">
                        <li>3 oz red jello (strawberry)</li>
                        <li>8 oz cool whip or real sweetened dairy cream whipped stiff</li>
                        <li>1 small can crushed pineapple (drained)</li>
                        <li>1 small jar cocktail or maraschino cherries cut into quarters</li>
                        <li>&half;-1 cup small marshmallows</li>
                        <li>Unsalted walnut or pecan halves (if desired) - best if lightly roasted first</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol id="instructions">
                        <li>Make the jello according to the box’s instructions. Most jello recipes need to be
                            refrigerated
                            3-4 hours or overnight.</li>
                        <li>Drain all the fruit and cut the cherries into quarters.</li>
                        <li>Once the jello is ready, stir it into the whipped cream. Keep the jello pieces larger (about
                            ½-1
                            inch) while stirring,
                            since they will most likely get more incorporated into the whipped cream once served.</li>
                        <li>Add in all the other ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <ul id="notes">
                        <li>This recipe serves 4-6 people (small batch). Double as many times as you need for larger
                            groups</li>
                        <li>Ambrosia stays firm for a day or two in the fridge, so it's best when it's fresh
                        </li>
                    </ul>
