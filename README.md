# Ambrosia Recipe
## Overview
This is a single page website that goes over my family's ambrosia recipe and the history behind it. It was created with basic HTML and CSS (including Flexbox), and I used Adobe Illustrator for the illustrations.

I created this website during LaunchCode's 2021 CoderGirl program.
