# Ambrosia Recipe
## Overview
This is a single page website that goes over my family's ambrosia recipe and the history behind it. It was created with basic HTML and CSS (including Flexbox), and I used Adobe Illustrator for the simple illustrations.

I created this website during LaunchCode's 2021 CoderGirl program. The instructions for the assignment can be found online [here](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/assignments/html-me-something.html).
